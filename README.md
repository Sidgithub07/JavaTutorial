# How To Run the Code
This is based on the Eclipse IDE. If you use any other IDE, the select process might be different.
First, Make sure the package explorer is showing the packages in a Hierarchical list and not a Flat list.
There should be a option to change that in the package explorer window at the top.
To run the code for a specific episode, right-click the package you wish to run and select "Run As" -> "Java Application".
